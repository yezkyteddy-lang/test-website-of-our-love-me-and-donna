Donnah, this past month with you has felt like a gentle sunrise I never want to leave behind. From the moment we started this chapter together, my heart has felt calmer, warmer, and fuller. You are not just someone I like being around—you are someone I look forward to every day.

Thank you for being part of my life. Thank you for the sweetness, the comfort, the laughter, and the quiet moments that have made me feel like I am exactly where I am meant to be. Even the simplest days feel brighter when I know you are in them.

This first month has taught me that love is not only in the big gestures but in the way you make my world feel easier and happier. I am grateful for every smile, every conversation, and every little memory we have started building together.

Happy 1st Monthsary, my love. I hope we keep making beautiful memories, one month at a time, one story at a time, forever.

With all my love,
Michael`,

I love the little moments: the way we talk, the way we laugh, the way even silence feels comfortable with you. It feels like growing into someone who wants to keep choosing you every single day. And the more I understand you, the more I admire you.

Thank you for being patient, kind, and beautiful in the way that you love. You are one of the easiest people I want to be near, and I am so thankful that this story is ours.

Every month with you is another chapter of our story. I cannot wait to keep writing it with you.
